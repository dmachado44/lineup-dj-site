                <h2>What Is a Walkout Song?</h2>
                <p>A walkout song (also called a walk-up song) is the music played as a batter walks from the on-deck circle to the batter's box. It's a player's chance to pump themselves up, engage the crowd, and showcase their personality. In little league and youth baseball, these 15–30 second clips create memorable game-day moments.</p>
